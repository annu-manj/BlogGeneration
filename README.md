# BlogGeneration

Streamlit web application designed for generating blog posts with the assistance of the LLama 2 language model. Users input the topic, desired word count, and select a style or category for the post. The application defines a function, getLLamaresponse, which orchestrates the interaction with the LLama 2 model, creating a prompt based on user inputs and retrieving a response.
